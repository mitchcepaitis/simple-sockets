# Simple Sockets

This script is meant to be used as a way to capture raw data communications between systems which are in your control.  This script is more of a practice exercise than an everyday tool.

Example use: intercepting communication between a web application front end and a back end program for the purpose of reverse engineering the custom protocol used.
  
Usage:
```bash
$ python simple-sockets.py <remote ip> <remote port> <local port>
```
