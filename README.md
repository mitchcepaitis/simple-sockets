# Simple Sockets

This script was created as an exercise to solve a custom protocol reverse engineering challenge.  While there are existing MITM type tools, this script was a good practice in socket programming and text handling.
  
Usage:
```bash
$ python simple-sockets.py <remote ip> <remote port> <local port>
```
